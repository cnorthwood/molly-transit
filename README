This is an app for Molly (http://mollyproject.org/) which was used to
demonstrate how to create a sample Molly app at Dev8D 2011

It provides a "transit line status" app on the Molly homepage, with two
providers to demonstrate the separation between providers and views.

It can display the London Underground line status (from TfL) and the status
of the Subway lines (from SPT).
